# Calibration

Purpose : Calibrating a humanoid's all views. 
Moving self driving by itself.


Humanoid service lists
1) baby caring
2) folding clothes
3) achoire route play

## Extrinsic Calibration
Reference Paper : Extrinsic Calibration of a Camera and Laser
Range Finder (improves camera calibration) 

Conditions :
1. There isn't any lens distortion predicted. 
2. Calibration's checkerboard is placed on Z = 0 of world coordinates. 
3. Laser points are placed on Y = 0 of world coordinates.


Lens Distortion
1. radial distortion
2. tangent distortion


# 1. Removing Lens Distortion - radial distortion
a. Pincushion distortion (positive radial distortion)
b. No distortion
c. Barrel distortion (negative radial distortion)

Barrel distortion
1. get a central point using 4 points.
