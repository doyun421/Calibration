# Purpose of Robotics Camera Calibration.

## Calibration
  1. Detecting correct path's line with 98% accuracy. 
      How to improve accuracy of detection.
      

      Accuracy Standarzation
         = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions
         = TP + TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN) 
         code : tn, fn, tp, fp = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred).ravel() 
                print ((tp+tn) / (tn+fn+tp+fp)) 
         
     
  3. Preventing accidents related with calibration inaccuracy causing issues. 
  4. High rates of rejected parts (Loss of finance) 
  5. Cost and time overruns 
  6. Avoiding customers inefficient additional requirements. 
  7. Preventing reputation damage.


### Types of Issues of Calibration

      a) Weather changes.
      b) Network Issues. 
      c) unpredicted visual affection. 
      d) embedded system's issue causing.
